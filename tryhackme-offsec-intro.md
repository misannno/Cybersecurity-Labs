**TryHackMe: Offensive Security Intro**

‚úÖ Date Completed:26th of March 2025

 What I Did
I completed the **Offensive Security Intro** challenge on TryHackMe, where I legally hacked a simulated website in a safe learning environment.  
This challenge introduced me to real-world concepts of web application vulnerabilities and how ethical hackers approach problem-solving.


üí° Key Learnings
- How to identify common website vulnerabilities such as insecure login panels and weak authentication.
- The importance of safe, legal platforms for practicing cybersecurity skills.
- That successful ethical hacking is built on curiosity, persistence, and understanding how attackers think.
